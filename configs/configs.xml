            activeSkeletons to allow.
            Setting higher than your actual percentage will result in poor performance because the adjuster will assume you have more
            time than available to calculate physics.

            calculate the maximumActiveSkeletons. Increasing sample size will flatten outliers but can slow adjustment responsiveness.
